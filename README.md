# ToDO App

I have coded this app using **ReactJS** which fetches todos data from *jsonplaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos)* and loads the TodoList React component with 5 randomly selected Todos. Users are able to add new Todo, select (strike-through) and delete Todos from the list.
